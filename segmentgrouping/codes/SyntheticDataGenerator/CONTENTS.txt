This directory contains the functionalty to generate artificial binary images
with annotations to train and evaluate segmentation methods.

gen_img.m
- A function to generate an arbitrary binary image of overlapping objects
  with known shape and the corresponding ground truth, i.e. the correct
  segmentation result and the parameters of each objects/segments.

gen_ellipse.m
- An example of a function that is called by gen_img() to draw a single 
  object. The function generates a binary image with an arbitrary ellipse in 
  arbitrary position.

gt_segment.m
- A function to get the ground truth segmentation result for k:th object as
  a binary image based on the ground truth cell array produced by gen_img().

configure01.m
- An example script to generate configure struct for gen_img().

example01.m
- An example script to generate one image and to plot the ground truth.

example02.m
- An example script to generate a set images with ground truth.
